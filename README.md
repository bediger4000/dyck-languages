There's an older programming job interview question:

---

Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets,
return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed).

For example, given the string "([])[]({})", you should return true.

Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.

I got this from the old [Daily Coding Problem]({{< "posts/daily-coding-problem.md" >}})
email list as "Daily Coding Problem: Problem #712 [Easy]",
and I'm certain those folks sent it out several times
while they were a going concern.
